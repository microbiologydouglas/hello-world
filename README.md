# hello-world

Hello. I am currently a very frustrated human who aspires to become a superprogrammer. I am following the directions in GitHub's Hello World tutorial, and they don't match the reality on the ground. I cannot decide if this is like Calculus-based Physics for the purpose of weeding out the weak, or just poor design of GitHub, or that GitHub is fine, and I am fine, but the tutorial is rubbish.
